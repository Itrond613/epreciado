        <h2>My Family</h2>
        <p>A little bit about my family.For all intents and purposes, I will only go back to my grandparents. On my dads side, his dad was born in 1924 in Damascus, Syria. That was his homeland, his true love. Unfortunatly, his family was expelled From Syria in the 50's, so he moved to Lebanon. There, he met my grandmother, Esther, an 8th generation lebanese woman. They set up a family in Lebanon where they had 4 kids, my dad being the youngest. In 1970, Leon relieved the nightmare he had in Damascus when he was again expelled, this time he decided to move to Israel. The story is shifting to my Dad, Ernest's perspective. He never had a recollection of Beirut, his birthplace. He was raised in israel until he was 16, then his family decided to move to Mexico. Now, lets go to my moms side. Her Dad Isaac was born in Mexico to a syrian family. when He was 18, he had relationship with my gramndma, Gina, and they had Vanessa, their only child. She wasn't jewish by law so she decided to convert. One day, she gets a call from a friend that he has the perfect husband for her in Miami. In 2005, she flew to Miami to meet Ernest, and happily ever after (with three children, including me!) </p>
